# KEY DIFFERENCES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION

- Text inputs only (for now)
- No extra components (unnecessary packages were removed to keep the project as small as possible)
- Piper tts support (it speaks back the same way as previous version did - a minimal model is being used instead of a medium one)

# PLANNED UPDATES

- Memory storage/retrieval module
- Speech to text support
- Some sort of a GUI to let you interact with the chatbot, remove/review/add memories
